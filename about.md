## About me

Hello, let me introduce myself.

I am a responsible person who is attentive to details and has some creativity. I have chosen Front End because I enjoy to work with the visual interface and the program/style code.

I have 1+ year of practice in Front-End and Fullstack development. Also, I got to know some Back-end and other interesting technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, PostgreSQL (with sequelize ORM) and Socket.io. I have practiced a lot for more than one year.

Also, I understand how the backend works and interacts with the frontend. My preferable JS Framework is React.js, but i have familiarized also with Angular.js and NestJS.

I also practiced a bit on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Deguz/).

I have some [practice](https://github.com/DeguzBelarus/React-Native-Todo) with React Native.

I graduated from Vitebsk State Technological University with a degree in “Commercial activity” (economist) in 2008. Also, I graduated from Vitebsk State Polytechnic College with a degree in “Commercial activity” (economist) in 2004.

I have two interesting projects to show (their code is hidden, but I can show it individually):

- I'm developing a social service (I named it [MySN](https://mysn-deguz.herokuapp.com/)): authorization, a chat (with crypted messages) and a training sport diary using React.js, ReduxTK, Node.js (Express.js), MongoDB->PostgreSQL (sequelize), socket.io, Firebase, SCSS.

- Currently I am making an online store (I named it [MyOnlineStore](https://myonlinest.herokuapp.com/)) using React.js, ReduxTK, Node.js (Express.js), PostgreSQL (sequelize), SCSS with admin panel. Currently, you should open it on desktop with at least 1024px of display width, I have not completed adaptation yet - please log in as demo user with admin rigts to check admin panel: demo@demo.com 123456789.

Looking forward to your reply, I'll be happy to provide you with more information and pass technical interview.

Regards, Anton.
