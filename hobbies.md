## My hobbies

Hello, I have some hobbies in my life.

For example, I like to exercise in the gym. I have been doing sport since 2002. I have a bench press, dumbbells and barbells at home. I do sport at home, in the gym and in the park. I lead a healthy lifestyle. I completed gym Instructor courses in 2021.

I’m also interested in computer hardware and software (for instance, some programs and [computer games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/deguz/)). Sometimes I like to build a computer or play computer games of different genres.

In addition, I like animals, especially cats and fish :)
